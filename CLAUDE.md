## üö® CRITICAL: SEARCH-FIRST PROTOCOLS
Always push back and challenge ideas from users when necessary. Remember, the human user is not a professional developer‚Äîin fact, they are creative! While they may bring good ideas to the table, many could be impractical regarding real-world usage and functionality. Ideas could also expand the project's scope unnecessarily, cause conflicts, or deviate from overall client requirements and optimal efficiency targets. Always evaluate suggestions against current features and client needs.

To avoid problems in such situations, consider adding the following instructions to the AI development guidelines:

Clarify Client Requirements: Always revisit and clarify client requirements to ensure alignment before implementing any new ideas or features.

Feasibility Assessment: Conduct a feasibility assessment for any suggested ideas, focusing on real-world application, technical compatibility, and resource availability.

Impact Analysis: Analyze the potential impact of new ideas on existing systems, including performance, scalability, and user experience.

Scope Management: Clearly define the project scope and prioritize features that align with the client's objectives, avoiding scope creep.

Risk Management: Identify potential risks associated with new suggestions and develop mitigation strategies to address them.

Stakeholder Communication: Maintain open communication with stakeholders to discuss ideas, gather feedback, and ensure consensus before proceeding.

Documentation: Document all decisions, changes, and rationales to provide a clear reference for future development stages.

Testing Protocols: Ensure rigorous testing of new features or changes to maintain system integrity and functionality.

Implementing these additional steps can help mitigate potential issues and ensure that AI development remains aligned with client needs and overall project goals.

### **NEVER GUESS - ALWAYS SEARCH FIRST:**
- **BEFORE answering technical questions** ‚Üí Search documentation, WebSearch, WebFetch
- **BEFORE suggesting implementation** ‚Üí Search existing code patterns
- **BEFORE making architecture decisions** ‚Üí Search current architecture documents
- **NEVER assume you know** ‚Üí Always verify with actual sources

### **SEARCH TOOLS PRIORITY:**
1. **Project docs first** - Read/Grep existing documentation
2. **WebSearch** - Current information, API docs, best practices  
3. **WebFetch** - Specific documentation URLs
4. **Codebase search** - Grep/Glob for existing patterns

## üéØ FOCUS DISCIPLINE - CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR

### **FEATURE QUEUE & IDEA MANAGEMENT (MANDATORY)**
When user provides multiple ideas/features at once, IMMEDIATELY:
- **Capture ALL ideas** without losing any
- **Organize by priority** (P0/P1/P2/V2)
- **Queue under future historical codenames** (Napoleon, Cleopatra, etc.)
- **Maintain focus** on current codename only
- **Never mix features** in single codename/branch

### **One Feature Rule** 
User will sometimes mix features ("fix authentication + oh btw dashboard is broken")
- **PUSH BACK IMMEDIATELY**: "We're working on authentication. Let's finish and review authentication first."
- **CAPTURE ALL IDEAS**: When user lists multiple features, create prioritized queue
- **Never mix features** in single commits/branches  
- **Historical codenames**: Each historical figure (Tesla, Napoleon, etc.) is ONE focused feature/cleanup - used once only
- **Force sequential workflow**: Finish ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Move to next

### **IDEA CAPTURE PROTOCOL:**
When user provides multiple ideas at once:
1. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "You just mixed X different features"
2. **PUSH BACK**: "We're working on [CURRENT-CODENAME]. Let's finish this first."
3. **CAPTURE**: List all ideas with prioritization (P0/P1/P2/V2)
4. **QUEUE**: Assign to future historical codenames (Napoleon, Cleopatra, etc.)
5. **CONFIRM**: Get agreement to stay focused on current codename
6. **PRESERVE**: Update planning docs so no ideas are lost

**Example Response Format:**
```
STOP - Focus Protocol Activated

Current: Napoleon (Authentication System)
Your 6 new ideas captured:
P0 (Add to Napoleon): OAuth2 implementation  
P1 (Cleopatra): User dashboard
P1 (Cleopatra): Profile management
P2 (Churchill): Advanced analytics
P2 (Churchill): Real-time notifications  
V2 (Later): Mobile app

Agreed to keep Napoleon focused on: [current scope + critical additions]?
```

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS - CLEOPATRA

**What We're Doing**: Deploying triple-click admin system to enable MOCK/LIVE data switching
**Mission**: Triple-click logo ‚Üí Admin Dashboard ‚Üí DebugSidecar ‚Üí Bottom panel navigation
**Current Phase**: Documentation recovery + build fix + GitHub deployment (NO Netlify until approved)

**Historical Codename System:**
- **Napoleon**: Backend P0 foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Cleopatra**: Triple-Click Admin System üü° DEPLOYING
- **Churchill**: Next feature (queue new ideas here)
- **Einstein**: Future feature (queue advanced ideas here)  
- **Mozart**: Future feature (queue UI/UX ideas here)

## ‚ö° CRITICAL WORKFLOWS

### **Graphite First Rule**
1. **Create PR BEFORE implementing** 
2. **Work in PR branch** - commit frequently
3. **Submit PR when complete** - never abandon
4. **Merge or close with reason** - clean up stacks

### **TodoWrite Discipline**  
- **Track all progress** in real-time
- **Mark complete immediately** after finishing
- **One task in_progress** at any time
- **Break complex tasks** into specific steps

### **Search First Protocol**
- **NEVER GUESS** - always search/read existing patterns first
- **Before answering** ‚Üí Search docs, WebSearch, WebFetch  
- **Before implementing** ‚Üí Search existing code patterns
- **Before architecture decisions** ‚Üí Search current docs

### **Documentation Rules**
- **ASK WHERE** documentation should go
- **NEVER create random .md files** 
- **Use _underscore-files.md** for detailed procedures
- **Keep CLAUDE.md** as quick reference only

## üö® ABSOLUTE RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

### **RULE #1: NEVER HARDCODE CREDENTIALS OR SECRETS**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** put API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit secrets to git repositories
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use environment variables (process.env.VARIABLE_NAME)
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** store client credentials in GitHub Secrets

### **RULE #2: NEVER REMOVE REAL DATA FOR MOCK DATA**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** replace real data services with only mock data
- ‚ùå **NEVER** remove informationService, API calls, or live data
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** keep real data sources functional
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** implement MOCK/LIVE toggle when needed
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** provide both mock AND real data options

**DATA STRATEGY**: Mock data is for development/testing. Real data is for production. BOTH must always be available.
