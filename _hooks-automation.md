# HOOKS AUTOMATION - BACKGROUND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

## ü™ù AUTOMATED HOOK SYSTEM - ALWAYS RUNNING

### **HOOK ANNOUNCEMENT PROTOCOL:**
All hooks automatically announce when they execute:
```javascript
console.log('üîî Hook: [Hook Name] executing...');
// This ensures visibility into background automation
```

### **ACTIVE HOOKS ECOSYSTEM:**
```javascript
const activeHooks = {
  dailySummary: "6pm daily or on-demand",
  problemSolver: "After 3+ attempts at same issue", 
  notification: "Task completion, errors, milestones",
  monitoring: "Every 15 minutes heartbeat",
  devLogger: "Complex problems solved (3+ attempts)"
};
```

  ]
};
```

### **DEV-LOGGER OUTPUT EXAMPLE:**
```markdown
# SOLUTION LOG: Triple-Click Admin System Not Working

**Date**: 2024-09-06  
**Time Invested**: 2.5 hours  
**Attempts**: 5 different approaches  

## üéØ PROBLEM
Triple-click logo activation for admin system not working on production site.

## üîç SYMPTOMS  
- Triple-click logo: No visual change
- Expected: Logo ‚Üí "Admin Dashboard" text + DebugSidecar appears
- Actual: Nothing happens

## üõ†Ô∏è DEBUGGING PROCESS
1. **Browser Console Check**: No errors visible
2. **Component Investigation**: Found wrong import path in PageLayout.tsx
3. **Build System Analysis**: informationService import causing failures
4. **Network Analysis**: Build not deploying due to compilation errors
5. **Root Cause**: Import path '../generated/TopNavigation' doesn't exist

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION
1. Fix import: `'../generated/TopNavigation'` ‚Üí `'../TopNavigation'`  
2. Remove informationService import
3. Replace with mock data array
4. Deploy corrected code

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION
- Add import path validation to CI/CD
- Create automated link checking
- Implement build failure alerts
- Document component locations clearly

## üß† KNOWLEDGE GAINED
- Import paths are critical for production builds
- Mock data strategy unblocks deployment
- Component communication via custom events
- Debugging production requires systematic approach

## üéØ HOOK COORDINATION & INTELLIGENCE

### **SMART HOOK INTERACTION:**
```javascript
const hookCoordination = {
  // Hooks communicate with each other
  problemSolver: {
    triggersDevLogger: "On complex solution",
    triggersNotification: "On solution found",
    updatesMonitoring: "Problem resolution status"
  },
  
  dailySummary: {
    aggregatesFrom: ["problemSolver", "devLogger", "monitoring"],
    includesNotificationHistory: true,
    providesLearningInsights: true
  },
  
  // Prevent hook conflicts
  executionQueue: {
    priority: ["monitoring", "problemSolver", "notification", "devLogger", "dailySummary"],
    concurrency: "Allow parallel except dailySummary",
    timeoutProtection: "30 seconds max per hook"
  }
};
```

### **HOOK PERFORMANCE METRICS:**
```javascript
const hookMetrics = {
  problemSolver: {
    averageResolutionTime: "15 minutes",
    successRate: "87%",

  },
  
  monitoring: {
    uptime: "99.8%", 
    falsePositives: "< 2%",
    earlyWarnings: "15 minutes average advance notice"
  },
