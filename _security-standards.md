## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### **JWT Security Implementation**
```javascript
const jwtSecurity = {
  secretGeneration: {
    method: "crypto.randomBytes(64)",
    storage: "Environment variables only",
    rotation: "90-day policy minimum"
  },
  
  tokenStructure: {
    header: "Algorithm specification (RS256 preferred)",
    payload: "Minimal claims, no sensitive data",
    signature: "HMAC SHA256 or RSA signatures"
  },
  
  validation: {
    expiration: "Short-lived tokens (15 minutes)",
    refresh: "Secure refresh token rotation",
    revocation: "Token blacklist capability"
  }
};
```

### **Password Security**
```javascript
const passwordSecurity = {
  hashing: {
    algorithm: "bcrypt",
    saltRounds: 12, // Minimum
    example: "bcrypt.hash(password, 12)"
  },
  
  policies: {
    minLength: 8,
    complexity: "Mixed case, numbers, symbols",
    history: "Prevent reuse of last 12 passwords",
    expiration: "90 days for privileged accounts"
  },
  
  storage: {
    never: "Plain text passwords",
    always: "Hashed with unique salts",
    location: "Secure database only"
  }
};
```

## üîí Data Protection

### **Encryption Standards**
```javascript
const encryptionStandards = {
  atRest: {
    algorithm: "AES-256-GCM",
    keyManagement: "Hardware Security Modules (HSM)",
    scope: "All sensitive data fields"
  },
  
  inTransit: {
    protocol: "TLS 1.3 minimum",
    certificates: "Valid SSL/TLS certificates",
    hsts: "HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled"
  },
  
  keyManagement: {
    rotation: "Annual key rotation minimum",
    storage: "Separate from encrypted data",
    access: "Role-based key access control"
  }
};
```

### **Sensitive Data Handling**
```javascript
const sensitiveDataProtection = {
  identification: [
    "Personal Identifiable Information (PII)",
    "Payment card data (PCI DSS)",
    "Health information (HIPAA)",
    "Authentication credentials",
    "Business secrets"
  ],
  
  protection: [
    "Encrypt at rest and in transit",
    "Tokenization for payment data",
    "Data masking in logs",
    "Access logging and monitoring",
    "Regular access reviews"
  ]
};
```

## üö´ Input Validation & Sanitization

### **Injection Prevention**
```javascript
const injectionPrevention = {
  sqlInjection: {
    solution: "Parameterized queries only",
    avoid: "String concatenation for SQL",
    example: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
  },
  
  xss: {
    solution: "Context-aware output encoding",
    avoid: "Unescaped user input in HTML",
    tools: "DOMPurify, validator.js"
  },
  
  commandInjection: {
    solution: "Input validation, avoid shell execution",
    avoid: "exec(), system() with user input",
    alternative: "Specific APIs instead of shell commands"
  }
};
```

### **Input Validation Rules**
```javascript
const inputValidation = {
  whitelistApproach: "Allow known good, reject everything else",
  
  validationLayers: [
    "Client-side: User experience",
    "Server-side: Security enforcement", 
    "Database: Constraint validation"
  ],
  
  commonValidations: {
    email: "RFC 5322 compliant format",
    phone: "International format validation",
    urls: "Protocol and domain validation",
    fileUploads: "Type, size, content validation"
  }
};
```

## üîç Security Scanning & Testing

**Security is not optional - it's a fundamental requirement. Every feature must be designed with security in mind, and security testing must be automated and continuous throughout the development lifecycle.**
