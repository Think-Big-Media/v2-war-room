# WAR ROOM DEPLOYMENT STATUS

## ✅ What's Working:
1. **Frontend Deployed**: https://war-room-3-1-ui.netlify.app
2. **Backend Health Check**: https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app/health
3. **Winston App Created**: winston-war-room-9cui (but deployment failed)

## 🔴 Current Issues:
1. **API Endpoints Not Found**: The backend health check works but specific endpoints return 404
2. **Winston Deployment Failed**: The new app couldn't deploy due to rollout errors
3. **Original Backend Has Issues**: The compilation error with cached files persists

## 📊 Backend Status:
- Health endpoint: ✅ Working
- Meta campaigns endpoint: ❌ 404 Not Found
- Mentionlytics endpoint: ❌ 404 Not Found
- Google Ads endpoint: ❌ 404 Not Found

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. **Check Frontend Console**: Open https://war-room-3-1-ui.netlify.app and check browser console for errors
2. **Verify API Routes**: The backend may be using different endpoint paths
3. **Local Testing**: Run the backend locally to verify endpoints

## 🔧 Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app/health

# Open frontend
open https://war-room-3-1-ui.netlify.app

# Check local backend
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4/war-room-4-4-backend
encore run --port=4002
```

## 💡 Possible Solutions:
1. **API Path Mismatch**: Frontend may be calling wrong API paths
2. **CORS Issues**: Backend may need CORS configuration
3. **Environment Variables**: Backend may be missing required secrets
4. **Use Local Backend**: Run backend locally and point frontend to localhost:4002
