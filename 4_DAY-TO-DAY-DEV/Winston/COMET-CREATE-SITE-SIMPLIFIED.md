### IF THAT DOESN'T WORK - Manual Creation:

1. **Click**: "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
2. **Connect**: GitHub
3. **Choose repository**: `Think-Big-Media/war-room-frontend`
4. **Pick branch**: The one that has the Winston preview (likely `main` or `winston`)
5. **BEFORE DEPLOYING**:
   - Site name: `winston-warroom`
   - Environment variables: Add `VITE_API_URL` = `https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app`

### IF NAME IS TAKEN:
Try these alternatives:
- `warroom-winston`
