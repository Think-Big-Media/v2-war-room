# ðŸŽ¯ ALTERNATIVE: Just Use the Existing Winston Preview!

## Instead of creating winston-warroom, we can use what already works:

### The Working Winston URL:
```
https://68bd51bc102fd200082c46bf--leafy-haupia-bf303b.netlify.app
```

This already has:
- âœ… Triple-click admin panel
- âœ… MOCK/LIVE toggle
- âœ… All Winston features

### Just Need to Update Its Backend:

**Give this to Comet:**
```
Update the environment variable for the Winston preview:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find the leafy-haupia-bf303b site
3. Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Update VITE_API_URL to: https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app
5. Go to Deploys tab
6. Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Clear cache and deploy site"
```

### This Gives Us:
- Working Winston frontend (already deployed)
- Connected to new backend
- No need to create new site
- Can still create winston-warroom later

### Test It:
```javascript
// After redeploy, go to Winston preview and run in console:
fetch('https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

## Or Create a Quick Alias:

If you want the winston-warroom name without creating new site:

1. Go to leafy-haupia site settings
2. Domain management
3. Add domain alias: `winston-warroom.netlify.app`
4. Now both URLs work for same site!

**This is simpler - just update the existing Winston preview's backend URL!**
