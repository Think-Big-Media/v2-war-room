# 🔧 FIX: Set App Root Path to /3_Backend_Codebase/4.4

## Current Issue:
✅ GitHub is connected to `Think-Big-Media/v2-war-room`  
❌ But it's looking at the repository root, not `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4`

## SOLUTION - Two Options:

### Option 1: Set App Root in Encore Settings (Preferred)
1. Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/settings/app
2. Look for **"App Root"** or **"Root Directory"** setting
3. Set it to: `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4`
4. Save changes
5. Go to Deploys page and click "Deploy Now"

### Option 2: Configure in encore.app File
Since GitHub is connected but looking at root, Encore needs to know where the actual backend code is.

Check if there's an `encore.app` file in the repository root. If not, we need to tell Encore where to find the backend:

1. In Encore Cloud, look for:
   - Build configuration
   - App settings
   - Deploy settings
   
2. Find where to specify the **subdirectory** or **app path**

3. Set it to: `3_Backend_Codebase/4.4` (without leading slash)

### Option 3: Move encore.app to Root (Quick Fix)
If the above doesn't work, we can create a root encore.app that points to the backend:

```bash
# Create encore.app in root that references the backend
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room
cat > encore.app << 'EOF'
{
  "$schema": "https://encore.dev/schemas/appfile/2025-09.json",
  "id": "war-room-backend-45",
  "name": "War Room Backend 4.5",
  "lang": "typescript",
  "root": "3_Backend_Codebase/4.4"
}
EOF

# Commit and push
git add encore.app
git commit -m "Add root encore.app pointing to backend folder"
git push origin main
```

### What Should Happen:
Once Encore knows to look in `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4`:
1. It will find the backend code
2. Build will succeed
3. Deployment will complete
4. You'll get your staging URL

### Check Deployment Status:
Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/deploys
- If there's a failed deployment, check the logs
- The error will likely say "no encore.app found" or similar
- Apply one of the fixes above

## The Good News:
✅ GitHub connection works!  
✅ All secrets are configured  
✅ Code is in GitHub  
❌ Just need to tell Encore WHERE in the repo to look

**Try Option 1 first (setting App Root in Encore settings). If that doesn't work, we'll do Option 3 (root encore.app file).**
