# ðŸš€ TRIGGER DEPLOYMENT MANUALLY

## Since UPDATE buttons are disabled, try these:

### Option 1: Direct Deploy Link
Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/deploys
- Look for a **"Deploy"** or **"New Deployment"** button
- Click it to manually trigger deployment

### Option 2: Push a Small Change to GitHub
This will trigger automatic deployment:

```bash
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4
echo "# Deployment trigger" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger Encore deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Check Environments Page
Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/envs
- Click on **"staging"** environment
- Look for **"Deploy"** button there

### Option 4: Use Encore CLI
```bash
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4
encore push
```

### Option 5: Create New Environment
If staging isn't deploying:
1. Go to Environments section
2. Create a new environment (e.g., "preview")
3. This might trigger initial deployment

## The Blue Banner Says It All
The banner "Looks like you haven't deployed this application yet. To use the dashboard, first deploy your app" means NO deployment has happened yet.

Since everything is configured (GitHub connected, root directory set, secrets added), we just need to trigger that first deployment.

## Most Likely Solution:
The **Deploys** page (https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/deploys) should have a button to start the first deployment. Look for:
- "Deploy Now"
- "Start Deployment"
- "Deploy to Staging"
- "New Deployment"

**Try Option 1 first (Deploys page), then Option 2 (push a change to trigger auto-deploy).**
