# üöÄ DEPLOY THROUGH ENCORE CLOUD UI

## Current Status
‚úÖ App created: `war-roombackend-45-x83i`  
‚úÖ All secrets configured  
‚úÖ App linked locally  
‚ùå Code not pushed (git.encore.cloud doesn't resolve)

## SOLUTION: Deploy Through GitHub Integration

Since the Encore CLI push isn't working, use the GitHub integration:

### Option 1: Fix GitHub Connection in Encore Cloud

1. **Go to**: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/settings/integrations/github
2. **Click**: "Connect GitHub Repository"
3. **Select**: `Think-Big-Media/v2-war-room`
4. **Set Branch**: `main`
5. **Set App Root**: `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4`
6. **Click**: "Save and Deploy"

If the repository doesn't appear:
- Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Encore
- Grant access to `Think-Big-Media` organization
- Return to Encore and refresh

### Option 2: Manual Git Push (Alternative Method)

Since `war-roombackend-45` app exists but needs code, we can push the 4.4 folder as a subtree:

```bash
# From the main repository root
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room

# First, ensure all 4.4 code is committed
git add 3_Backend_Codebase/4.4
git commit -m "OPERATION OVERLORD: Prepare 4.4 for deployment"

# Push to GitHub first
git push origin main

# Then in Encore Cloud UI, trigger deployment
```

### Option 3: Create Fresh Deployment with Working GitHub

If GitHub connection still fails:

1. **Delete** the current `war-roombackend-45` app
2. **Create new app** with GitHub connected from start:
   - Name: `war-room-backend-45-fresh`
   - Import from: GitHub (ensure it works)
   - Repository: `Think-Big-Media/v2-war-room`
   - Path: `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4`

### Option 4: Use Encore Build + Manual Upload

```bash
# Build locally
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4
encore build docker

# This creates a Docker image that can be deployed
```

## What Should Work

Once GitHub is connected properly:
1. Every push to `main` branch triggers deployment
2. Encore watches `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4` folder
3. Deployment completes in 2-5 minutes
4. Staging URL becomes active

## Current Blockers & Solutions

**Problem**: `git.encore.cloud` doesn't resolve  
**Solution**: Use GitHub integration instead

**Problem**: GitHub repo not appearing  
**Solution**: Grant Encore access to Think-Big-Media org

**Problem**: Deploy button grayed out  
**Solution**: Code must be connected via GitHub first

## Next Steps

1. **Fix GitHub connection** in Encore Cloud UI
2. **Verify** repository appears in dropdown
3. **Connect** and set path to `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4`
4. **Deploy** will start automatically
5. **Get staging URL** once deployed

## URLs to Use

- **Encore Dashboard**: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i
- **GitHub Settings**: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/settings/integrations/github
- **Deployment Page**: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/deploys

**The issue is GitHub connection, not the code. Once GitHub is connected, deployment is automatic.**
