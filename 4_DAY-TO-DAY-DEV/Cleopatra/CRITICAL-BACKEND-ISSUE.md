# üö® CLEOPATRA DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER: Backend Returns HTML Not JSON

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The reason LIVE data doesn't work is that our Encore backends are deployed as frontend HTML apps instead of JSON API servers.

## The Problem
- Backend URLs return `<html>` instead of `{"status": "ok"}`
- This breaks ALL LIVE data connections
- Only MOCK data works (which is perfect for demos)

## Backend Versions
- ‚ùå 4.2: Not working
- ‚ùå 4.3: Created to fix 4.2  
- üéØ **4.4: CURRENT TARGET** (forked from 4.3)

## URLs That Need Fixing
```bash
# Currently returns HTML (BROKEN):
https://war-room-backend-d2qou4c82vjjq794glog.lp.dev/health

# Should return JSON (NEEDED):
{"status": "ok", "services": {"database": "connected"}}
```

## Fix Required
1. Redeploy 4.4 backend in Encore as API server
2. Update netlify.toml with correct 4.4 URL
3. Test LIVE data works

## Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend 100% ready for deployment
- ‚úÖ Admin system complete with MOCK/LIVE toggle
- ‚ùå Backend deployment needs fix

**Once backend fixed ‚Üí Deploy frontend immediately ‚Üí LIVE data works!**
