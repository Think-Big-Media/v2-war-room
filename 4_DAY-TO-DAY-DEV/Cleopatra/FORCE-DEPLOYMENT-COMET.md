# COMET PROMPT: Force New Deployment

## FORCE A NEW DEPLOYMENT

Since updating the path didn't auto-trigger, we need to manually force a deployment.

### Option 1: Direct Deploy Button
1. Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/envs/staging
2. Look for a **DEPLOY** button (black button, top right)
3. Click it to manually trigger deployment
4. If it asks for a commit, select the latest one

### Option 2: Deploys Page
1. Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/deploys
2. Look for:
   - "New Deployment" button
   - "Deploy" button
   - "Create Deployment" button
   - Plus (+) icon
3. Click it
4. Select:
   - Environment: **staging**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Commit: **latest** (or the one that says "Trigger Encore deployment")

### Option 3: Push Another Change
If no deploy buttons work, let's force it with a new commit:

Tell me to run this command:
```
cd /Users/rodericandrews/Obsidian/Master/_Projects/_War-Room-AI/v2-war-room/3_Backend_Codebase/4.4/war-room-4-4-backend
echo "# Force deploy $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force Encore deployment - correct path"
git push origin main
```

### Option 4: Check Build/Deploy Triggers
1. Go to: https://app.encore.cloud/war-roombackend-45-x83i/settings/integrations/github
2. Check if "Auto-deploy on push" is enabled
3. If not, enable it
4. Then push a change (Option 3)

### What to Look For:
- Any button that says: DEPLOY, Deploy Now, New Deployment, Trigger Deploy
- Any way to manually start a build
- Build/Deploy section in settings

### If Nothing Works:
Tell me:
1. Can you see any DEPLOY button anywhere?
2. Is the Root Directory now showing `3_Backend_Codebase/4.4/war-room-4-4-backend`?
3. Are there any error messages?
4. Can you see the failed deployment details/logs?

**The path is correct now. We just need to trigger a new deployment with the updated path!**
