   - Actual election dates
   - Voter registration info
   - Early voting locations

2. **Activity Score** will include:

   - Election frequency
   - Civic engagement metrics

3. **State Details** will display:
   - Current representatives (Senators, House members)
   - Local officials
   - Contact information
   - Social media links

## Both APIs Now Working! ðŸŽ‰

Your `.env.local` file now has:
```
VITE_FEC_API_KEY=3kSPSUh0S5UnrM3XCLYLQcS1H31ILf04n5nqr9He
VITE_GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY=AIzaSyB_m_vkKpNG3jAX8rrORBXC0KFlyS4PGWo
```

## Test the Full Integration

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   cd 2_Frontend_Codebase/3.1-ui-war-room-netlify-clean
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the dashboard** at http://localhost:5173

3. **Click on the political map**

4. **Test each data layer**:
   - **Finance Layer** â†’ Shows FEC campaign contribution data
   - **Elections Layer** â†’ Shows Google Civic polling/election data
   - **Activity Layer** â†’ Combines both APIs for overall political activity

5. **Click on any state** to see detailed information from both APIs

## What You're Getting

### From FEC API:
- Campaign contributions: Real dollar amounts
- Top donors by state
- PAC activity
- Updates every 15 minutes

### From Google Civic API:
- Current elected officials
- Polling locations
- Voter registration deadlines
- Contact info for representatives

## Rate Limits
- **Google Civic**: 25,000 requests per day (FREE)
- **FEC**: 1,000 requests per hour (FREE)

## Success Indicators
âœ… Finance layer shows real contribution amounts
âœ… Elections layer shows polling locations
âœ… Clicking states shows representative names
âœ… No more "Mock Data" indicator when APIs are working

## Troubleshooting

If data doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Make sure `.env.local` file is in the right location
3. Restart the dev server after adding environment variables
4. Clear browser cache

## Next Steps

The only API left is Democracy Works (requires approval). But with FEC + Google Civic, you already have:
- Real campaign finance data
- Real representative information
- Real polling locations
- Real election dates

Your political map is now showing **REAL DATA** instead of mock data!
