## ðŸŽ¯ LEAP.NEW PROMPT - STAGE 3 ADS

Build War Room V2 ads integration using existing foundation. Add Google Ads and Meta Business APIs for viewing campaigns only.

**CHAIRMAN'S NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:**
- OAuth2 flows for external APIs
- All API secrets via Encore secrets (never hardcode)
- Rate limiting and caching for external API calls
- Viewing only - no campaign creation functionality yet

**Core Services:**

1. **Google Ads Integration** - Read-only Google Ads API v16 integration. OAuth2 authentication flow. Endpoints: GET /api/v1/google-ads/campaigns, GET /api/v1/google-ads/performance, GET /api/v1/google-ads/insights. Use Encore secrets for API credentials.

2. **Meta Ads Integration** - Read-only Meta Business API v19.0 integration. OAuth2 authentication flow. Endpoints: GET /api/v1/meta-ads/campaigns, GET /api/v1/meta-ads/performance, GET /api/v1/meta-ads/insights. Facebook/Instagram campaign viewing only.

3. **Reports Service** - Async PDF generation using Encore Pub/Sub topic "pdf-generation". Queue PDF requests, background worker processes them, store in Object Storage Bucket. Never synchronous PDF generation.

**Technical Requirements:**
- OAuth2 + PKCE flow for Google Ads
- OAuth2 app-scoped IDs for Meta Business
- Retry logic and circuit breakers for external APIs
- 15-minute cache TTL for ads performance data
- Rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion

**Data Sources Architecture:**
Enable 6 data sources: Mentionlytics â†’ Dashboard â†’ Relevant pages user journey.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Google/Meta OAuth2 flows working
- Campaign viewing endpoints functional
- No campaign creation abilities (viewing only)

Focus on reliable data viewing. P1 priority after chat system.
