# üî¥ LIVE DATA FIX - DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED
**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: FIX READY - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED  

## üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### Root Cause Found:
The webhook integration in `/api/v1/mentionlytics/feed` was **COMMENTED OUT** in production code!

```javascript
// Lines 157-183 were disabled with comment:
// "BrandMentions webhook temporarily disabled for clean testing"
```

### Fix Applied:
‚úÖ **Code Fixed** - Webhook priority re-enabled in `mentionlytics/api.ts`
‚úÖ **Committed** - "Enable webhook data priority for BrandMentions integration"
‚ùå **Not Deployed** - Git remote issue blocking deployment

## üìä CURRENT SITUATION

### What's Working:
- Webhook endpoint (`/api/v1/webhook/slack`) - Accepts data ‚úÖ
- Webhook storage code - Fully implemented ‚úÖ
- Frontend LIVE mode - Correctly configured ‚úÖ

### What's Broken:
- Production backend ignores webhook data (old code running)
- Feed endpoint returns only fallback data
- Live Intelligence shows empty in dashboard

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Encore Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to https://app.encore.cloud
2. Login with project credentials
3. Find `war-roombackend-45` app
4. Trigger manual deployment
5. Select the latest commit with webhook fix

### Option 2: Fix Git Remote
```bash
# Remove broken remote
git remote remove encore

# Re-add correct remote (get URL from Encore dashboard)
git remote add encore [CORRECT-URL]

# Push changes
git push encore main
```

### Option 3: Deploy New App
```bash
# Create new Encore app
encore app create war-room-backend-fixed

# Deploy with webhook enabled
git push encore main
```

## üîÑ AFTER DEPLOYMENT

Once deployed, test the full data flow:

```bash
# 1. Send test data to webhook
curl -X POST https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app/api/v1/webhook/slack \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "LIVE DATA TEST: Jack Harrison gains momentum in swing states",
    "channel": "war-room-mentions",
    "user": "BrandMentions"
  }'

# 2. Check if data is stored
curl https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app/api/v1/mentionlytics/feed

# 3. Verify in dashboard
# Go to https://war-room-3-1-ui.netlify.app
# Switch to LIVE mode
# Check Live Intelligence section
```

## üí° KEY INSIGHT

The entire infrastructure is ready and working. The ONLY issue is that production is running code with the webhook integration commented out. Once the fixed code deploys, live data will flow immediately.

## üìù FILES CHANGED

1. `/3_Backend_Codebase/4.5/mentionlytics/api.ts`
   - Lines 157-180: Uncommented webhook priority
   - Removed "testing mode" message
   - Re-enabled `getStoredMentions()` call

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Deploy the backend through Encore dashboard since git remote is broken.

1. Visit https://app.encore.cloud
2. Deploy the latest commit
3. Test webhook ‚Üí feed ‚Üí dashboard flow

---

**STATUS**: Code fixed, deployment needed to enable live data flow.
