# 🎖️ CHURCHILL SITREP - LIVE DATA & ADMIN DASHBOARD
**Codename**: CHURCHILL  
**Mission**: Get LIVE data flowing from BrandMentions → Dashboard  
**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE  

## 📊 BATTLEFIELD ASSESSMENT

### Current Assets:
- **Frontend**: https://war-room-3-1-ui.netlify.app (DEPLOYED)
- **Backend**: https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app (DEPLOYED)
- **Deployment ID**: 1pqgmacb0mg9ss87pmne (SUCCESS)

### Data Pipeline Status:
```
BrandMentions (3,229 mentions)
    ↓ 8am daily
Slack (#war-room-mentions in Modern Foundry)
    ↓ webhook
Backend (/api/v1/webhook/slack) ✅ RECEIVING
    ↓ [BROKEN LINK]
Dashboard Live Intelligence ❌ NOT DISPLAYING
```

## 🔍 INTELLIGENCE REPORT

### What Winston Accomplished:
1. **Identified webhook exists** at `/api/v1/webhook/slack` (returns 200)
2. **Frontend configured** with correct backend URL
3. **Dashboard in LIVE mode** - successfully calling API
4. **Created webhook storage code** - not yet deployed

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **Webhook is a dead end** - accepts data but doesn't store it
2. **Mentions feed disconnected** - returns only 1 sample mention
3. **Live Intelligence empty** - no data flowing through
4. **Mock/Live toggle exists** but needs documentation

## 🎯 CHURCHILL OBJECTIVES

### Primary Mission: Get LIVE Data Working
1. **Fix webhook → feed connection**
2. **Deploy storage integration**
3. **Verify Live Intelligence populates**
4. **Document Mock/Live toggle system**

### Secondary Mission: Admin Dashboard
1. **Verify admin access works**
2. **Document admin features**
3. **Test data management capabilities**

## 🛠️ TACTICAL PLAN

### Phase 1: Data Connection (Priority 0)
- [ ] Deploy webhook storage integration
- [ ] Connect webhook to mentions feed
- [ ] Test data flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify Live Intelligence displays real data

### Phase 2: Mock/Live Toggle (Priority 1)
- [ ] Document toggle location and usage
- [ ] Add toggle to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Create user guide for switching modes
- [ ] Test both modes thoroughly

### Phase 3: Admin Dashboard (Priority 2)
- [ ] Access admin interface
- [ ] Document admin capabilities
- [ ] Test data management features
- [ ] Create admin user guide

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Mock/Live Toggle Implementation:
```javascript
// Frontend toggle (in browser console)
localStorage.setItem('VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA', 'false'); // LIVE mode
localStorage.setItem('VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA', 'true');  // MOCK mode
location.reload();
```

### Webhook Test Command:
```bash
curl -X POST https://staging-war-roombackend-45-x83i.encr.app/api/v1/webhook/slack \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Test mention from BrandMentions"}'
```

### API Endpoints:
- Health: `GET /health` ✅
- Webhook: `POST /api/v1/webhook/slack` ✅
- Mentions Feed: `GET /api/v1/mentionlytics/feed` ⚠️ (returns 1 sample)
- Stored Mentions: `GET /api/v1/mentionlytics/stored` ❌ (not found)

## 📈 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Mission Complete When:
1. ✅ Live Intelligence shows real BrandMentions data
2. ✅ Mock/Live toggle documented and working
3. ✅ Admin dashboard accessible and documented
4. ✅ Data flows: BrandMentions → Slack → Backend → Dashboard
5. ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with Mock/Live system

## 🚨 RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk:
- Webhook integration may require Encore dashboard access
- Backend deployment process unclear (git remote issues)

### Medium Risk:
- Mock/Live toggle may affect other components
- Admin dashboard permissions unclear

### Low Risk:
- Frontend changes (already deployed successfully)
- Documentation updates

## 📝 NOTES FROM COMMAND

### User Requirements:
1. "Main goal—everything we're doing today—is to get live data working"
2. "Mock data is what we already have"
3. "Need to get that live mock data switch going"
4. "Let's get the admin dashboard working"

### Terminology Preference:
- Use "SITREP" instead of "changelog"
- More thorough documentation required
