# ‚úÖ LIVE DATA FIXES COMPLETE

## üéØ Problems Found & Fixed

### 1. Backend Issue (NEEDS DEPLOYMENT)
- **Problem**: Webhook integration commented out in production
- **Fix**: Uncommented lines 157-180 in `mentionlytics/api.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed locally, ‚ùå Not deployed yet

### 2. Frontend Issues (FIXED)
- **Problem 1**: Services checking `import.meta.env` at build time instead of runtime
- **Problem 2**: This caused the "flash of real data" before reverting to mock
- **Fix**: Changed to runtime localStorage checks in:
  - `DataService.ts` - Now uses `getUseMock()` function
  - `useWarRoomData.ts` - Now checks localStorage at runtime
  - `mentionlyticsService.ts` - Defaults to LIVE mode, sets localStorage

## üìä Current Data Flow Status

### Working:
- `/api/v1/mentionlytics/sentiment` ‚úÖ Returns real sentiment (45/25/30)
- `/api/v1/mentionlytics/geo` ‚úÖ Returns 3 states for map
- Map component shows real geographic data

### Not Working (Until Backend Deployed):
- `/api/v1/mentionlytics/feed` ‚ùå Returns only 1 sample mention
- Live Intelligence section shows mock data
- Webhook data not being stored/retrieved

## üöÄ To Complete Live Data:

### Step 1: Deploy Backend
Go to https://app.encore.cloud and deploy the latest commit with webhook fix

### Step 2: Test Live Data
```bash
# Clear localStorage to ensure LIVE mode
localStorage.removeItem('VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA')

# Or explicitly set to LIVE
localStorage.setItem('VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA', 'false')

# Refresh page
location.reload()
```

### Step 3: Verify Real Data
- Sentiment should show real percentages (not mock)
- Map already shows real state data
- After backend deploy, Live Intelligence will show real mentions

## üí° Key Insights

1. **The 33% you saw was REAL DATA!** The sentiment endpoint IS working
2. **Frontend was reverting to mock** due to build-time environment checks
3. **Backend just needs deployment** to enable full live data flow

## üìà Expected Results After Backend Deploy

1. Webhook will store incoming BrandMentions data
2. Feed endpoint will return stored mentions
3. Live Intelligence will populate with real social media data
4. Dashboard will show real-time updates

---

**STATUS**: Frontend fixed and ready. Backend fixed but needs deployment.
