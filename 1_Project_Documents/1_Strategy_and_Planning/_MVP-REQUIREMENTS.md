DELETE /api/v1/files/:id     // Delete uploaded file

// Requirements:
- File storage (local or cloud)
- Progress tracking
- PDF support (critical for client)
- File validation (size, type)
```

### SETTINGS SERVICE (Priority 3)
```typescript
// Required endpoints:
GET  /api/v1/settings        // Load user settings
PATCH /api/v1/settings       // Save setting changes

// Requirements:
- Settings persistence
- User-specific storage
- JSON structure for flexibility
```

### DOCUMENT ANALYSIS SERVICE (Priority 4)
```typescript
// Required endpoints:
POST /api/v1/documents/analyze  // Process document for AI context
POST /api/v1/chat/ask-document  // Query document via AI

// Requirements:
- PDF text extraction
- Document chunking for AI context
- Integration with chat service
- Basic search capability
```

### DATA PERSISTENCE
```sql
-- Required tables:
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  messages JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE uploaded_files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  filename TEXT,
  file_path TEXT,
  file_size INTEGER,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE user_settings (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  settings JSONB,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## ‚ùå NOT NEEDED FOR CLIENT TESTING
- Enterprise monitoring systems
- Advanced analytics dashboards  
- 8-type data flows
- Real-time WebSockets
- SMS/WhatsApp alerts
- Crisis detection algorithms
- SWOT radar complex visualizations
- Advanced authentication (JWT refresh, etc.)
- Rate limiting and caching
- Performance monitoring
- Vector search (can use simple text search initially)

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### SECRETS CONFIGURATION
```bash
# Required in Encore/GitHub Secrets:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
JWT_SECRET=secure-random-string
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
FILE_STORAGE_PATH=/uploads
```

### ENVIRONMENT SETUP
- [ ] Database initialized with required tables
- [ ] File upload directory created
- [ ] CORS configured for frontend domain
- [ ] Error logging enabled
- [ ] API rate limiting (basic)

### FRONTEND INTEGRATION
```typescript
// Frontend API configuration:
const API_BASE = 'https://war-room-backend-xyz.lp.dev';
const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  chat: '/api/v1/chat',
  files: '/api/v1/files', 
  settings: '/api/v1/settings',
  documents: '/api/v1/documents'
};
```

## ‚úÖ CLIENT TESTING SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Client can test TODAY when:**
- **Chat**: User can send message, AI responds, conversation saves
- **Upload**: User can upload a file, see progress, file is stored
- **Save**: User can retrieve previous chats and uploaded files
- **Settings**: User can change preferences, they persist
- **Ask AI**: User can ask questions about uploaded documents

**Evidence Required:**
- Video demo of each feature working
- Client can independently test all 5 features
- No major errors during basic usage
- Data persists between browser sessions

## üìä TODAY'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

| Time | Task | Leap.new Prompt | Status |
|------|------|-----------------|--------|
| 10:00-12:00 | Chat + Upload Services | Build core API endpoints | ‚è≥ |
| 12:00-14:00 | Settings + Database | Add persistence layer | ‚è≥ |
| 14:00-16:00 | Document Analysis | AI integration for "Ask" | ‚è≥ |

| 17:00-18:00 | Testing & Demo | Verify all 5 features | ‚è≥ |
| **END OF DAY** | **Client Demo Ready** | **All 5 P0 Features** | **üéØ** |

## üéØ LEAP.NEW PROMPT STRATEGY

### PROMPT 1: Core Backend Services
```
Build War Room backend with 4 essential endpoints:
- Chat service with OpenAI integration
- File upload with PDF support 
- Settings persistence
- Basic user sessions

Use Encore framework, PostgreSQL database, JWT auth.
Priority: Client testing of chat, upload, save, settings.
```

### PROMPT 2: Document Analysis 
```
Add document analysis service to existing backend:
- PDF text extraction
- AI-powered document Q&A
- Integration with chat service
- "Ask AI" functionality for uploaded files
```

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
**Client can demonstrate:**
1. Send chat message ‚Üí AI responds ‚Üí conversation saves
2. Upload PDF file ‚Üí file appears in interface
3. Change settings ‚Üí refresh page ‚Üí settings persist
4. Upload document ‚Üí ask question ‚Üí AI references content
5. All features work without errors

**Evidence**: Screen recording of all 5 features working end-to-end
