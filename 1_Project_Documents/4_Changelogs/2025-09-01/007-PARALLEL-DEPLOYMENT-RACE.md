# PARALLEL DEPLOYMENT RACE
**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Time**: 11:00 AM PST
**Status**: 🏁 RACE STARTING
**Strategy**: Deploy BOTH solutions simultaneously

---

## 🏁 THE RACE: Two Parallel Deployments

### Track 1: LEAP.NEW DEPLOYMENT
- **Project**: war-room-3-backend (original)
- **Status**: Configuration fixed by Leap
- **Changes**: TypeScript configuration corrected
- **Next Step**: MERGE and DEPLOY

### Track 2: CLEAN LOCAL DEPLOYMENT  
- **Project**: war-room-3-2-backend (new)
- **Status**: Fresh from clean local code
- **Changes**: Starting from known good state
- **Next Step**: Create and DEPLOY

---

## 📊 RACE METRICS TO TRACK

### Deployment Speed
- Leap deployment start time: ___
- Local deployment start time: ___
- Leap deployment complete: ___
- Local deployment complete: ___
- **Winner**: ___

### Success Metrics
- Which deploys successfully first?
- Which has fewer errors?
- Which Meta endpoint works?
- Which is easier to configure?

### Complexity Metrics
- Leap: Fixing existing project
- Local: Creating new project
- Time to configure secrets
- Time to verify endpoints

---

## 🎯 RACE ADVANTAGES

### LEAP.NEW Advantages
- ✅ Already has all the code changes
- ✅ Secrets might already be configured
- ✅ Leap fixed the configuration issues
- ✅ One-click merge and deploy

### LOCAL CLEAN Advantages
- ✅ No experimental baggage
- ✅ Full control over configuration
- ✅ Known good starting point
- ✅ No mysterious errors

---

## 🚀 RACE EXECUTION PLAN

### SIMULTANEOUSLY EXECUTE:

#### Track 1: LEAP Deployment
1. MERGE the changes in Leap.new
2. Watch deployment in Encore Cloud
3. Test Meta endpoint when ready
4. Document any errors

#### Track 2: Local Clean Deployment
1. Create war-room-3-2-backend locally
2. Initialize and push to Encore
3. Configure secrets
4. Test Meta endpoint when ready

---

## 🏆 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Best Case: BOTH WORK
- We have redundancy
- Can choose the cleaner one
- Learn what worked best

### Likely Case: ONE WORKS
- We have a working deployment
- Learn what caused the other to fail
- Can apply lessons learned

### Worst Case: BOTH FAIL DIFFERENTLY
- Learn two different failure modes
- Can create a third approach
- More debugging information
