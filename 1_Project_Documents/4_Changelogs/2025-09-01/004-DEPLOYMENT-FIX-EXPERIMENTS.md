# DEPLOYMENT FIX - REMOVED EXPERIMENTS CONFIG
**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Time**: 10:00 AM PST
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Experimental config in encore.app

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### The Problem
- **Local builds**: Succeeded
- **Deployment builds**: Failed with "unknown experiment: encore.dev/experiments/sqldb"
- **Deployment blocked**: Both staging and production

### Investigation Found
```json
// encore.app BEFORE (causing failure):
{
  "id": "war-room-3-backend",
  "experiments": ["encore.dev/experiments/sqldb"]  // ‚Üê THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
}
```

### The Fix
```json
// encore.app AFTER (fixed):
{
  "id": "war-room-3-backend"
}
```

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

### What Was Checked
- ‚úÖ No experimental imports in TypeScript files
- ‚úÖ No frontend/ directory in backend
- ‚úÖ No UI serving code
- ‚úÖ Build successful after removing experiments

### Clean State Confirmed
- **Experiments**: Removed from encore.app
- **Frontend service**: Already removed in previous cleanup
- **Build status**: Successful
- **Ready for deployment**: YES

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy to Staging** 
2. **Verify deployment succeeds**
3. **Test Meta API endpoint**
4. **Merge if successful**

---

**Key Learning**: The `experiments` array in encore.app can block deployments even if local builds work. Always check encore.app configuration when deployment fails but local builds succeed.
