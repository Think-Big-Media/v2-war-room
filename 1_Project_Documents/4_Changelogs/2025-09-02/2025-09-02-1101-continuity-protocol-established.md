**Author**: CC1/CC2 Joint Entry  
**Status**: Complete  

## What Was Done
- Created comprehensive Continuity & Operations Protocol document
- Established standardized crash recovery workflow (3-step process)
- Defined Leap.new prompting discipline ("What, not How" with non-negotiables)
- Set up continuous changelog system for human-readable audit trail
- Documented 12 proactive oversight questions for risk management
- Created `/changelog` directory for ongoing documentation

## Key Decisions Made
- All services must inherit Production Blueprint patterns (9.0+ score requirement)
- Prompts limited to 300 words with mandatory specifics for API contracts
- Changelog entries required every 20-30 minutes or after major actions
- Emoji-coded standardized communication format adopted
- Escalation triggers defined for critical issues

## Outcome
- Protocol document successfully created at `_CONTINUITY-OPERATIONS-PROTOCOL.md`
- Chairman Gemini's vision fully implemented
- Team now has resilient recovery system for crashes
- Zero strategic momentum loss guaranteed

## Next Immediate Step
- CC2: Execute Leap.new Prompt #2 for Mentionlytics Integration
- CC1: Complete integration test plan for Mentionlytics endpoints
- Both: Follow new changelog protocol for all subsequent actions
