**Date**: 2025-09-02 13:20
**Author**: CC1
**Status**: Complete

## What Was Done
- Terminated invalid Vercel deployment: 30-ui-war-room-4mx22mxme-growthpigs-projects.vercel.app
- Removed deployment using `npx vercel rm` command
- Acknowledged critical architectural deviation per Chairman's SITREP

## Root Cause Analysis
- Failed to adhere to Operational Protocol Section 1: Crash Recovery Workflow
- Did not properly read master documents before executing deployment
- Misunderstood project architecture (deployed to wrong platform)

## Architectural Ground Truth Established
- **CORRECT ARCHITECTURE**: Frontend + Backend both deploy to Leap.new â†’ Encore platform
- **INVALID ARCHITECTURE**: External deployments to Vercel/Netlify/Render
- All services must be within Encore environment for proper integration

## Outcome
- Success: Invalid deployment completely removed
- Success: No loose ends remaining from architectural deviation
- Process failure caught and corrected before integration testing phase

## Next Immediate Step
- Execute LEAP.NEW PREVIEW FRONTEND PROMPT within Encore environment
- Deploy minimal preview frontend for API validation testing
