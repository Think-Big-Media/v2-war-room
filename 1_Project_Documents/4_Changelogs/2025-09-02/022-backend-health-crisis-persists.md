# Backend Health Crisis - Emergency Database Reset Required
**Date**: 2025-09-02 16:15  
**Author**: CC2  
**Status**: Critical - Project Blocked  

## What Was Done
- Executed backend health crisis resolution prompt via Leap
- Comet validation confirmed health checks are still failing
- Code fixes applied (CORS centralization, simplified health checks) but runtime still broken
- All endpoints continue returning "500: app start failed: timeout waiting for app to become healthy"
- Frontend validation interface works but cannot test any backend endpoints

## Current Crisis Status
- **Build State**: ✅ Successful - code fixes applied
- **Runtime State**: ❌ CRITICAL - App never reaches healthy state
- **Database**: Suspected migration/connection issues preventing startup
- **All Endpoints**: 0/9 working - everything returns 500 timeout errors

## Root Cause Analysis
- UUID migration may have left database in inconsistent state
- Services cannot initialize due to database connectivity issues
- Health checks timeout after 10-12 seconds waiting for app to become healthy
- Preview environment requires complete database reset and fresh start

## Emergency Action Taken
- Escalated to emergency database reset prompt via Leap
- Nuclear option: Complete database wipe and fresh migration application
- Targeting complete app restart to resolve initialization failures

## Next Immediate Steps
- Execute database reset and fresh startup via Leap
- Confirm all services initialize properly after reset
- Re-validate basic endpoint connectivity (200/401 responses instead of 500)
- Resume comprehensive endpoint validation once health restored

## Impact Assessment
- Project completely blocked until health crisis resolved
- Cannot deploy any services to production with 500 errors
- Frontend validation interface ready but unusable without working backend
