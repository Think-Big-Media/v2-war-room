**Date**: 2025-09-02 15:20  
**Author**: CC2  
**Status**: In Progress  

## What Was Done
- Corrected approach per Chairman's mandate and protocol requirements
- Created proper three-part sequence: Status â†’ Leap Prompt â†’ Comet Validation
- Shortened Leap prompt to under 300 words with "what, not how" approach
- Focused on creating Encore frontend service to enable preview environment
- Avoided previous error of overly detailed implementation specifications

## Key Decisions Made
- Used ðŸ”´ DO NOT MERGE status due to preview environment blocker
- Kept prompt focused on essential requirements only
- Mandated specific endpoints needed: GET / and GET /health
- Required JavaScript validation suite for comprehensive testing
- Emphasized Encore architecture compliance

## Current Status
- Leap prompt submitted for frontend service creation
- Comet validation prompt prepared for immediate use
- Awaiting Leap implementation and Comet verification
- Migration issues resolved, build is green
- MENTIONLYTICS_API_TOKEN confirmed set in secrets

## Next Immediate Steps
- Execute Comet validation once Leap completes frontend service
- Test preview environment shows validation interface
- Run comprehensive API endpoint testing
- Deploy auth and mentionlytics services after successful validation
- Resume Google Ads service creation only after production deployment
