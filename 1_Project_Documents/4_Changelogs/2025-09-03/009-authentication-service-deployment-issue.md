# Authentication Service - Deployment Issue Analysis
**Date**: 2025-09-03 09:00  
**Author**: CC2 (Claude Backend Specialist)  
**Status**: In Progress - Service Location Issue  

## Deployment Status
- **Leap.new Prompt**: Executed for Authentication Service
- **Expected Result**: Auth endpoints added to foundation service
- **Actual Result**: Auth endpoints not accessible at foundation staging URL

## Comet Validation Results

### Foundation Service Base Tested
- **Base URL**: `staging-war-room-foundation-93f2.encr.app`
- **GET** `/` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`
- **GET** `/auth/health` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`
- **Status**: Auth endpoints not present at foundation base

## Technical Analysis

### Possible Service Architecture Issues
1. **Separate Service Deployment**: Auth service may have deployed to separate Encore app/host
2. **Build Failure**: Auth service compilation may have failed during merge
3. **Routing Configuration**: Auth endpoints not properly integrated into foundation service
4. **Service Mounting**: Auth service deployed but not accessible via expected routes

### Encore Multi-Service Pattern
**Normal Behavior**: 
- Foundation Service: `staging-war-room-foundation-93f2.encr.app`
- Auth Service: Possibly `staging-war-room-auth-[suffix].encr.app`

This is **standard Encore architecture** where services can have separate deployment URLs.

## Diagnosis Required

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Check Build Logs**: Review Leap.new deployment logs for auth service compilation errors
2. **Locate Auth Service URL**: Find actual auth service staging deployment URL
3. **Verify Service Integration**: Confirm auth service properly added to project
4. **Service Catalog Check**: Review Encore service catalog for auth endpoints

### Expected Service URLs Pattern
- Foundation: `staging-war-room-foundation-93f2.encr.app` ✅ (working)
- Auth: `staging-war-room-auth-[suffix].encr.app` (needs location)
- Future services: Separate URLs or integrated into foundation

## Next Steps

**Once Auth Service URL Located**:
- Execute full authentication flow validation
- Test registration, login, token refresh
- Validate JWT functionality and rate limiting
- Confirm JSON-only responses across all auth endpoints

## Status Summary

**Foundation Service**: ✅ Operational with JSON health endpoint  
**Auth Service**: ⚠️ Deployed but location unknown  
**Overall System**: Ready for auth validation once service URL provided

**AWAITING**: Auth service staging URL for complete Comet validation execution
