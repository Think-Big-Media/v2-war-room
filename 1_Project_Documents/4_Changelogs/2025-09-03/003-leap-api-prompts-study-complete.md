# Sept-1-Leap-API-Prompts Study Complete
**Date**: 2025-09-03 07:50  
**Author**: CC2 (Claude Backend Specialist)  
**Status**: Complete - Full Understanding Achieved  

## What Was Done
- **Protocol Correction**: Understood MERGE/DEPLOY status must come first in three-part sequence
- **Complete Study**: Read and analyzed all 7 Leap API prompts from September 1st
- **Architecture Understanding**: Grasped the full scope of Meta/Google Ads API integration requirements
- **Production Context**: Understood existing credentials, endpoints, and data structures

## Critical Findings

### Architecture Required (From Leap Prompts)
**Meta API Integration (Prompts 1-3)**:
- Connection setup with Facebook Business SDK
- Real campaign data fetching with proper field mapping
- Data validation ensuring frontend compatibility

**Google Ads Integration (Prompts 4-6)**:
- Connection setup with Google Ads API library
- Campaign data with micros currency conversion
- Performance optimization with caching

**End-to-End Testing (Prompt 7)**:
- Health check endpoint `/api/v1/campaigns/health`
- Error recovery and fallback to mock data
- Performance testing and monitoring

### What Needs Updating for 4.0 
**Key Changes Since September 1st**:
1. **JSON-Only Requirement**: All endpoints must return JSON (no HTML/preview UI)
2. **Health Endpoint**: Should be `/api/v1/health` not `/api/v1/campaigns/health`
3. **Foundation-First**: Start with basic health service before complex integrations
4. **Environment Clean**: New backend won't have existing mock implementations to replace

### Production Credentials Available
- **Meta**: App ID `917316510623086`, access token and secret configured
- **Google**: Client ID `808203781238-dgqv5sga2q1r1ls6n77fc40g3idu8h1o`, developer token `h3cQ3ss7lesG9dP0tC56ig`
- **Backend Target**: Need new 4.0 API War Room URL (will replace war-room-3-backend-d2msjrk82vjjq794glog.lp.dev)

## Strategic Understanding

### What We're Building
1. **Foundation Layer**: Health service with PostgreSQL connection
2. **Authentication Layer**: JWT-based auth service
3. **Campaign Management**: Meta and Google Ads API integrations  
4. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time status and health checks
5. **Intelligence Layer**: AI analysis and insights
6. **Alert System**: Crisis detection and notifications
7. **Analytics Layer**: Data aggregation and reporting
8. **Admin Layer**: Management interface (JSON API only)

### Critical Success Factors
- **No Preview UI**: Pure JSON API responses only
- **Real Data Flow**: Replace all mock implementations with live API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data on API failures
- **Performance**: Sub-3 second response times with caching
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and API quota tracking

## Next Immediate Step
Create corrected Foundation Health Service prompt following proper protocol:
1. **MERGE/DEPLOY STATUS**: âšª FIRST SERVICE - No previous service to merge
2. **LEAP.NEW PROMPT**: Foundation health service with JSON-only responses
3. **COMET VALIDATION**: Test health endpoint returns JSON

**UNDERSTANDING CONFIRMED**: Ready to create 4.0 API War Room with proper foundation-first approach, incorporating all lessons from September 1st integration plan while adapting for JSON-only requirement.
