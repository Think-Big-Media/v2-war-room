# Authentication Service - Deployment Error Analysis
**Date**: 2025-09-03 08:25  
**Author**: CC2 (Claude Backend Specialist)  
**Status**: In Progress - Deployment Issue Diagnosed  

## What Happened
- **Protocol Break**: Chairman merged and deployed without validation (acknowledged - won't repeat)
- **Deployment Attempt**: Authentication service merge attempted in Leap.new
- **Issue Discovered**: Auth endpoints not present at expected staging URL
- **Comet Validation**: Confirmed auth service not deployed at health-service domain

## Comet Validation Results

### Endpoints Tested
Base URL: `staging-war-room-health-service` domain
- **GET** `/auth` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`
- **GET** `/auth/health` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`  
- **GET** `/auth/register` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`
- **GET** `/auth/login` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`
- **GET** `/auth/me` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`
- **GET** `/auth/refresh` → `{"code":"not_found","message":"endpoint not found","details":null}`

### Technical Analysis
- **Service Separation**: Auth service appears to be separate service with own URL (not same domain as health)
- **JSON Responses**: Good news - all error responses are JSON-only (no HTML contamination)
- **Encore Architecture**: Platform correctly returns structured JSON errors
- **Missing Deployment**: Auth service not successfully deployed or at different endpoint

## Root Cause Assessment

**Likely Issues**:
1. **Service Build Error**: Auth service may have failed to compile/deploy
2. **Separate Service URL**: Auth service deployed to different staging URL  
3. **Routing Configuration**: Auth endpoints not properly registered in existing service
4. **Merge Conflict**: Authentication service code not properly integrated

## Encore Multi-Service Architecture

**Understanding**: Based on ref-docs/encore-docs, each service can have its own deployment URL:
- Health Service: `staging-war-room-health-service`
- Auth Service: Likely `staging-war-room-auth-service` or similar
- This is normal Encore multi-service pattern

## Next Steps Required

**1. Check Build Logs**: Review Leap.new deployment logs for auth service errors
**2. Find Auth Service URL**: Locate actual auth service staging URL
**3. Debug Service Integration**: Ensure auth service properly added to project
**4. Test When Available**: Ready to run full auth flow validation once URL provided

## Error Recovery Protocol

Following EncoreNuggets.md wisdom:
- Don't panic - this is likely deployment/routing issue
- Check build logs first (most common cause)
- Services may deploy to separate URLs (normal)
- Fix root cause before proceeding to validation

**STATUS**: Awaiting build logs and auth service URL for proper validation. Ready to test full JWT flow once service is accessible.
