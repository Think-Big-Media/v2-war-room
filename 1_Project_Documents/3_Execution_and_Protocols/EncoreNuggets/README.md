## üìö KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION

This folder contains all the practical knowledge gained during War Room development, organized into focused documents that can be updated independently as we learn.

### **01-Platform-Insights.md** 
Core Leap.new and Encore platform behaviors, development patterns, database management, and service architecture fundamentals.

**Add new discoveries here when you learn:**
- New Leap.new prompt patterns that work better
- Encore service architecture insights
- Database migration strategies
- Performance optimization discoveries

### **02-Critical-Gotchas.md**
Mistakes we've made and the correct solutions we discovered. Every error that cost us time is documented to prevent repetition.

**Add new gotchas here when you encounter:**
- Deployment failures and their fixes
- Configuration mistakes and solutions  
- Integration issues and resolutions
- Any problem that took >30 minutes to solve

### **03-Success-Patterns.md**
Proven approaches that work consistently. Documented processes that save time and deliver results.

**Add new patterns here when you discover:**
- Workflow improvements that increase velocity
- Integration techniques that work reliably
- Debugging approaches that solve problems quickly
- Any process that works better than expected

### **04-Architecture-Discoveries.md**
Architectural breakthroughs and patterns discovered specifically during War Room development.

**Add new discoveries here when you find:**
- New architectural patterns for the War Room platform
- Service integration discoveries
- Performance architecture insights
- Security architecture improvements

## üìã UPDATE PROTOCOL

### When to Update Each Document

**During Development:**
- **Gotcha discovered** ‚Üí Add to `02-Critical-Gotchas.md` immediately
- **New pattern works** ‚Üí Document in `03-Success-Patterns.md`
- **Platform behavior learned** ‚Üí Add to `01-Platform-Insights.md`
- **Architecture breakthrough** ‚Üí Document in `04-Architecture-Discoveries.md`

### How to Update
1. **Read the existing document** to avoid duplicating content
2. **Add to the appropriate section** with clear headers
3. **Include specific details** - code examples, exact commands, error messages
4. **Update the "Last Updated" date** at the top of the document
5. **Test your documented solution** to ensure accuracy

## üéØ USING THIS KNOWLEDGE

### For New Team Members
Start with `01-Platform-Insights.md` to understand the platform fundamentals, then review `02-Critical-Gotchas.md` to avoid known mistakes.

### For Development Work
- **Before starting**: Check relevant sections for known patterns
- **When stuck**: Review `02-Critical-Gotchas.md` for similar issues
- **After solving**: Document new discoveries in appropriate section

### For Architecture Planning
Review `04-Architecture-Discoveries.md` for War Room-specific patterns before designing new services or integrations.

## üîÆ KNOWLEDGE EVOLUTION

This is a **living knowledge base** that grows with our experience. Every mistake teaches us something, every breakthrough gets documented, and every pattern that works gets preserved.

**The goal**: Transform 8 hours of painful trial-and-error into 2 hours of smooth, informed development.

---

**Remember**: The best time to document knowledge is immediately after learning it. Don't let valuable insights get lost in the heat of development.
