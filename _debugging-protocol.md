# Debugging Protocol - Evidence-Based Troubleshooting
**Referenced by**: CLAUDE.md  
**Source**: Universal Claude System

## 🚨 MANDATORY PROCESS
**Before ANY debugging or deployment work, follow this checklist religiously:**

## PHASE 1: INFORMATION GATHERING (MANDATORY)

### **1. Demand Evidence First (Human-in-the-Loop Blocker)**
- **Say**: "STOP - I need logs and dashboard screenshots before I can help effectively"
- Get deployment dashboard screenshot showing ALL services
- Obtain last 50-100 lines of build logs from failing deployment
- Get browser error message (exact status codes: 502, 404, timeout, etc.)
- Verify git log shows expected latest commit

### **2. Service Count Audit**
- Count ALL services in deployment dashboard
- **Red flag**: Multiple services with same repo deploying simultaneously
- **Action**: Delete duplicates immediately - they cause 30+ minute failures
- Verify only ONE service should be active for the project

### **3. Path & Directory Verification**
- Ask: "Which exact URL should work?"
- Verify frontend build directory: `/dist` vs `/src/dist` vs `/src/frontend/dist`
- Check backend server script location and startup command
- **Common error**: Production serving stale frontend from wrong directory

## PHASE 2: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **4. Build Command Investigation**
- Get EXACT build command being used (dashboard vs YAML)
- **Red flags**:
  - `npm ci` failing (use `npm install`)
  - Missing `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
  - Rollup errors about optional dependencies
- Compare local vs production build commands

### **5. Environment Variables Audit**
- List ALL environment variables
- **Critical vars**: Node version, Python version, PORT, custom build flags
- **Missing vars often cause**: Rollup errors, build timeouts, 502s

### **6. Timing & Auto-Deploy Reality Check**
- Don't assume "auto-deploy" means "immediately live"
- Wait 2-5 minutes after git push before debugging
- **Red flag**: Build taking >15 minutes = something is wrong

## PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING

### **7. Fix One Thing at a Time**
- Make ONE change, verify result, then proceed
- Don't shotgun multiple fixes simultaneously
- Document what was changed and why

### **8. Test Simple Before Complex**
- Test `/health` endpoint before debugging OAuth integration
- Verify basic service response before feature debugging
- Check if static assets load before dynamic content

## PHASE 4: COMMON GOTCHAS (LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE)

### **9. Specific Technical Red Flags**
- **Error**: "Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu"
  - **Fix**: Add `ROLLUP_SKIP_NODE_BUILD=true`, remove package-lock.json
- **Status**: 502 Bad Gateway for >10 minutes
  - **Fix**: Service never started, check build logs
- **Status**: 404 transitioning from 502
  - **Good**: Service starting, wait 2-3 more minutes
- **Multiple "Deploying" status** lasting >20 minutes
  - **Fix**: Delete duplicate services immediately

### **10. Dashboard vs Code Reality**
- What dashboard shows ≠ what's actually running
- Verify configuration is applied by checking service behavior
- **Test**: Make a trivial change and verify it appears live

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### **When to Use "Nuclear Options":**
- Build failing for >30 minutes
- Multiple duplicate services
- Rollup/npm dependency hell
- Stale frontend serving wrong content

### **Nuclear Option Checklist:**
1. Delete all duplicate services
2. Remove `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`
3. Use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
4. Add `ROLLUP_SKIP_NODE_BUILD=true`
5. Create fresh service if needed

## 💬 HUMAN COMMUNICATION

### **What to Say to Human:**
- **"I need to see the deployment logs before I can help effectively"**
- **"Can you screenshot your dashboard showing all services?"**
- **"This looks like [specific issue]. Here's exactly what to do..."**
- **"Let's fix this one thing first, then test, then continue"**

### **What NOT to Say:**
- ❌ "Let me make some changes and see if it works"
- ❌ "The deployment should be working"
- ❌ "Try running this and let me know what happens"

## 📝 EXAMPLE OPENING RESPONSE:
*"Before I start debugging, I need to see what's actually happening. This will save us both hours. Can you:*
1. *Screenshot your deployment dashboard showing all services and their status*
2. *Share the last 50 lines of build logs from the failing deployment*
3. *Confirm the exact URL that should be working*
4. *Show me any error messages you're seeing in the browser*

*Based on today's experience, 90% of deployment issues are: duplicate services, wrong build paths, or missing environment variables. Let's identify which one this is before making any code changes."*

**REMEMBER**: Logs reveal truth. Code changes without seeing logs are just expensive guesses.
