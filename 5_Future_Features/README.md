## 🔍 Project Guidelines

### **Historical Codename Rules**
- **One feature per codename** - focused development
- **Use once only** - no recycling names
- **Complete before next** - sequential workflow
- **Document thoroughly** - preserve learnings

### **Feature Capture Protocol**
When user suggests new features:
1. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "You mentioned X features"
2. **PUSH BACK**: "We're focused on [CURRENT] first"
3. **CAPTURE**: List all ideas with ICE scoring
4. **QUEUE**: Assign to future codenames
5. **CONFIRM**: Agreement to stay focused
