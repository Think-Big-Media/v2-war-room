## ⚖️ ICE Score Calculation

```
Impact:     6/10  (Moderate administrative value)
×
Confidence: 7/10  (High technical confidence)  
×
Ease:       4/10  (High implementation complexity)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Total:      168   (6 × 7 × 4 = 168)
```

### **ICE Score Interpretation**
- **>400**: High priority, implement immediately  
- **200-400**: Medium priority, plan for next quarter
- **<200**: Low priority, defer or deprioritize
- **Marcus Aurelius: 168** → **LOW PRIORITY - DEFER**

## 🚨 Risk-Adjusted ICE Analysis

### **Worst-Case Scenario Impact**
If implementation takes 50% longer and delivers 50% less value:
- **Adjusted Impact**: 3/10 (50% value reduction)
- **Adjusted Ease**: 2/10 (50% more complexity)  
- **Risk-Adjusted ICE**: 3 × 7 × 2 = **42**

### **Best-Case Scenario Impact**  
If implementation is optimized and delivers higher value:
- **Adjusted Impact**: 8/10 (Higher operational value)
- **Adjusted Ease**: 6/10 (Streamlined implementation)
- **Best-Case ICE**: 8 × 7 × 6 = **336**

### **Expected Value Range**: 42-336 (Current: 168)
**Recommendation remains**: **DEFER** - Even best-case scenario doesn't justify immediate prioritization over user-facing features.
